# MBCB - Genetic Alterations and Functional Impact

For this session, we will analyse some data from the 2022 mpox (formerly known as Monkeypox) outbreak in Portugal.

We will start with data from the [first cases](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01907-y) in early May 2022.

Briefly, total DNA was extracted from the clinical sample, and shotgun metagenomics sequencing was performed (more details available in the paper). Reads were human-depleted using BMTagger and subsequently mapped to the reference genome [MPXV-UK_P2 MT903344.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT903344.1).

We are going to analyse data from the sample [Monkeypox/PT0005/2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/ON585037.1). Due to ethical reasons, only the reads mapping to the monkeypox virus reference are submitted to public repositories, and that is what we will use in our analysis.

We first need to map the raw sequencing files to the reference genome. As you saw in the previous session, for this, we need the fastq files of our sample, as well as the fasta file of the reference genome. Then, we will use bwa to align the reads and samtools to transform the SAM file that is the output of bwa into a sorted, indexed, BAM file that will be used for further analysis.

-  **TASK**: Download the fasta file of the reference from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT903344.1

As in the last session, we will make use of [docker](https://www.docker.com/) images to facilitate reproducible installation of different bioinformatic tools in (almost) any environment. The following tasks assume the environment you are working in has already docker installed and ready to use.

-  **TASK**: Download the paired fastq files using sra-tools fasterq-dump with the repository id ERR9769171  
<details><summary>Click Here to see a hint</summary><p>  

  If you have not done so before, pull a docker image for sra-tools eg.:
> docker pull ncbi/sra-tools:3.0.1

Next, run fasterq-dump using the sra-tools docker image:
> docker run --rm -v $PWD:/data ncbi/sra-tools:3.0.1 fasterq-dump --outdir /data ERR9769171

</p></details>


-  **TASK**: Generate an indexed BAM file with the alignments of the monkeypox sample reads against the MT903344.1 reference

If you have not done so before, pull a docker image for bwa and samtools eg.:
> docker pull biocontainers/bwa:v0.7.17-3-deb_cv1
> docker pull biocontainers/

We first need to create an index of the reference genome to be able to use bwa to align the reads against the reference. 
> docker run --rm -v $PWD:/data biocontainers/bwa:v0.7.17-3-deb_cv1 bwa index MT903344.1.fasta

Next we use bwa to generate alignments:
> docker run --rm -v $PWD:/data biocontainers/bwa:v0.7.17-3-deb_cv1 bwa index MT903344.1.fasta

Finally, we use samtools to convert the sam to bam, sort it by position, and index it.
